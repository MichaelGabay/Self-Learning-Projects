# 🎮 Simon Game Challenge

Welcome to the Simon Game project! Your goal is to build a game where players must remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds using JavaScript and jQuery.

## 📂 Project Structure

You have been provided with the following starting files:

- `index.html`: The main skeleton of the game.
- `styles.css`: The styling for the buttons and layout.
- `sounds/`: A folder containing the audio files (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, Wrong).
- `game.js`: **(You need to create this)** This is where your game logic will live.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

To keep your code organized, you should define the following specific variables and functions in your `game.js` file before writing the logic steps.

### 1. Required Variables

| Variable Name | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `buttonColours` | Array | Holds the possible colors: `["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]`. |
| `gamePattern` | Array | Stores the random pattern generated by the game. |
| `userClickedPattern` | Array | Stores the pattern clicked by the player (must be reset every level). |
| `started` | Boolean | Keeps track of whether the game is currently running (default: `false`). |
| `level` | Number | Keeps track of the current level (default: `0`). |

### 2. Required Functions

| Function Name | Parameters | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `nextSequence()` | None | Generates a new random color, adds it to the sequence, and advances the level. |
| `checkAnswer()` | `currentLevel` | Checks if the user's most recent click matches the game pattern at that specific index. |
| `playSound()` | `name` | Takes a color name (or "wrong") and plays the corresponding audio file. |
| `animatePress()` | `currentColor` | Adds a CSS class (e.g., `.pressed`) to the button and removes it after 100ms. |
| `startOver()` | None | Resets the `level`, `gamePattern`, and `started` variables when the game ends. |

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

Follow these phases to build the game logic.

### Phase 1: Setup & Initialization
- [ ] Create a new file called `game.js`.
- [ ] Link jQuery and your `game.js` to `index.html` (place the scripts right before the closing `</body>` tag).
- [ ] Use jQuery to detect the **first keyboard key press**.
  - If `started` is false: change the `h1` title to "Level 0", call `nextSequence()`, and set `started` to true.

### Phase 2: The Game Sequence (`nextSequence`)
- [ ] Reset `userClickedPattern` to an empty array `[]` (the user needs a fresh start for every level).
- [ ] Increment the `level` variable and update the `h1` text.
- [ ] Generate a random number between 0 and 3.
- [ ] Use the number to pick a color from `buttonColours` and push it to `gamePattern`.
- [ ] Select the button with the same ID, animate it (flash), and play its sound.

### Phase 3: User Interaction
- [ ] Use jQuery to detect clicks on any button with the class `.btn`.
- [ ] Inside the click handler:
  - Get the `id` of the clicked button (this is the color).
  - Push that color to the `userClickedPattern` array.
  - Call `playSound()` for that color.
  - Call `animatePress()` for visual feedback.
  - **Crucial:** Call `checkAnswer()` passing in the index of the last answer (e.g., `userClickedPattern.length - 1`).

### Phase 4: The Logic Check (`checkAnswer`)
- [ ] **Scenario A: The User is Correct (So far)**
  - If `gamePattern[currentLevel]` is equal to `userClickedPattern[currentLevel]`:
    - Check if the user has finished the sequence (Are the arrays the same length?).
    - If finished, call `nextSequence()` after a 1000ms delay.
- [ ] **Scenario B: The User is Wrong**
  - If the values do not match:
    - Play the "wrong" sound.
    - Add the class `game-over` to the `body` (remove it after 200ms).
    - Change the `h1` title to "Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart".
    - Call `startOver()`.

### Phase 5: Reset (`startOver`)
- [ ] Inside this function, reset your tracking variables:
  - Set `level` back to 0.
  - Clear the `gamePattern` array.
  - Set `started` back to `false`.
