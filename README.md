# Self-Learning Projects Repository 🎲

Welcome to the self-learning projects repository! This repository is designed to help you practice and improve your programming skills across various technologies and languages.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by technology. Each main directory corresponds to a specific programming language or framework (e.g., `Html`,`Css`, `JavaScript`, `ReactJS`, `Python`, `Java` etc.).

Inside each technology folder, you will find multiple project folders. Each project is a self-contained exercise.

The structure looks like this:
