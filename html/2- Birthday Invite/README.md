# 🎉 Birthday Invite Project 🎉

This project is a simple exercise in creating a single-page website for a birthday invitation using basic HTML. The goal is to build a page that visually matches the `goal.png` image. 🖼️

To get started, create an `index.html` file. Inside this file, you'll build out the structure of the invitation. You should use standard HTML tags to structure the content.

The page should have a main title, a subtitle for the date, and an image of a birthday cake 🎂. Following that, create a section that lists what guests should bring 🎁, and finally, a section that provides a link to the location on Google Maps 📍.

Think about which HTML tags are most appropriate for each piece of content. For example, use heading tags like `<h1>` and `<h2>` for titles, an `<img>` tag for the image, `<ul>` and `<li>` for the list, and an `<a>` tag for the map link.

Once you have added all the content, save the file and open it in your browser to see your work. 👀
