# HTML Learning Path 📄

Welcome to the HTML learning path! This guide will take you from HTML basics to advanced semantic HTML and modern web standards in a structured, progressive manner.

## Introduction

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the foundation of every website. It's the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML defines the elements that make up a webpage - headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. Without HTML, there would be no web pages.

### Why Learn HTML?

- **Foundation of Web Development**: Every website starts with HTML
- **Essential Skill**: Required knowledge for any web-related career
- **Easy to Start**: Simple syntax makes it beginner-friendly
- **Universal Standard**: Works on all browsers and devices
- **Career Gateway**: First step toward becoming a web developer, front-end developer, or full-stack developer
- **SEO and Accessibility**: Proper HTML structure improves search rankings and accessibility

### Prerequisites

Before starting this HTML learning path, you should have:

- Basic computer literacy
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No prior programming experience needed!

**Happy Coding! 📄**

Remember: HTML is the foundation of web development. Take time to understand each concept deeply. Practice by building real projects, even simple ones. Every website you visit is built with HTML - you're learning the language of the web! Once you master HTML, you'll be ready to add styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.
