# 🎨 HTML & CSS Final Project: Build Your Own Website

Congratulations on completing the HTML & CSS module! For your final assignment, you are tasked with designing and developing a fully responsive, multi-page website.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of web structure, styling, layout, and responsiveness. You have complete creative freedom regarding the **topic** of your website. It can be a portfolio, a blog, a business site for a fictional company, a fan site, or anything else that interests you.

## ⚙️ Core Requirements

### 1. Site Structure (4 Pages Minimum)

Your website must contain at least **four distinct HTML pages**. A navigation bar (menu) must be present on all pages to allow easy movement between them.

- **1. Home Page (`index.html`):** The main landing page. It should be visually engaging and introduce the topic of the site.
- **2. Contact Page (`contact.html`):** This page must include a functional-looking **Form**.
  - _Required fields:_ Name, Email, Message (textarea), and a Submit button - feel free to add more input types.
- **3. Choice Page A (`about.html` or `gallery.html`):** Content of your choice.
- **4. Choice Page B (`faq.html` or `services.html`):** We recommend an **FAQ** page, but you may choose another type suitable for your topic.

### 2. Design & Layout

- **Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive. It should look professional on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Aesthetics:** The site should be visually appealing. Pay attention to spacing (margin/padding), color distinctiveness, and typography.
- **Images:** Use images relevant to your topic.

### 3. Technology Stack

You may use any of the following methods to style your project:

- **Pure CSS** (using Flexbox and Grid).
- **Bootstrap.**
- **Tailwind CSS.**

> **Note:** Regardless of the framework you choose, your HTML code must be semantic and clean.
